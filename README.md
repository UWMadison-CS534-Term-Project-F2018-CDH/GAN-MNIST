# GAN-MNIST
First GAN for project using the MNIST digit library.

We trained against the MNIST library while collecting our video game sprites.
This allowed us time to learn Keras.

We developed both a GAN and an autoencoder using this dataset to learn how Keras
operates. See our other repositories for game specific sprites.
